## 2.6.0 // 2025-08-09
This release brings significant improvements to the build system and typography handling, along with important bug fixes for percentage formatting across different languages. The modernized build pipeline delivers better performance and smaller bundle sizes while maintaining compatibility across all supported environments.

### ✨ New features
- Fix dash between word and a number, e.g. `Access full ETF holdings—not just the top 10—and explore…`

### 🐛 Fixes
- if there is a space between a digit and a percentage sign (i.e. 15 %), now it will be:
  - removed for `en-us` ([source](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Numbers/faq0005.html))
  - changed to a narrow non-breaking space for `de-de` ([source](https://german.stackexchange.com/questions/41550/what-does-din-5008-exactly-say-about-percent-character))
  - changed to a non-breaking space for `sk`, `cs`, `rue`

### 💪 Improvements
- Typopo now has separate builds to be used as ES module, CommonJS import, and for direct browser usage. 
- `removeWhitespacesBeforeMarkdownList: false` now also keeps spaces before nested markdown blockquotes 
- CommonJS and UMD distributions were reduced ~25% in bundle size.

### 🔨 Maintenance
- Reorganize the folder structure
- Update NPM packages to their latest versions 
- Refactor the source code
- Remove unused packages
- Update the build pipeline to Vite and Vitest

### 🔨 Maintenance
- Update NPM packages to their latest versions



## 2.5.5 // 2023-08-27

  - `‘Sentence ending …’` → `‘Sentence ending…’`

### 🐛 Fixes
- Update use cases when a space between the number sign (#) and the number is removed. Before, the space was falsely removed between level 2 markdown headings and numbers (e.g. “## 1. introduction” was falsely changed to “##1. introduction”). Now the space is kept. (bug reported by [@filipaldi](https://github.com/filipaldi))
- A dash was not fixed between words, when the first word ended on a letter “ŷ”
- An nbsp was falsely added after a word that had the letter “ŷ” on the second to the last past position, e.g. nbsp was falsely added after the word “starŷm”

  - e.g.“something” → e.g. “something”
- Consolidate spaces around ellipsis that replaces the last item in the list
  - We sell apples, oranges, … → We sell apples, oranges,…
  - (apples, oranges, … ) → (apples, oranges,…)

  - “He was ok”. “He was ok”. → “He was ok.” “He was ok.”

### 🔨 Maintenance
- Update NPM packages to their latest versions



## 2.5.2 // 2021-09-04
No changes in functionality in this release, just repackaging the bundle.



## 2.5.1 // 2021-09-04
No changes in functionality in this release, just updating package dependencies to their latest versions.



## 2.5.0 // 2021-06-08
I’ve done something in this version what I wanted to do for a while. I wanted to refactor modules that fix double quotes and single quotes. These modules were old and difficult to improve. And as I went along refactoring, I’ve also fixed few other issues, so in the end, quite a few things made it into this version.

Since this version (2.5.0), Typopo is tested against 2540 assertion tests (+675 tests since version 2.4.1). The number of tests is not a guarantee there won’t be any bugs, but it indicates a growing desire to cover more and more edge cases.

Here’s a rundown of what’s been new and improved in this version.


### ✨ New features
New configuration option to keep Markdown code blocks in your Markdown files:
- `keepMarkdownCodeBlocks: true` when you want to keep Markdown code blocks in your Markdown files
- `keepMarkdownCodeBlocks: false` want to fix grave accents (`) in generic texts to single quotes 


### ⚡️ Improvements
- Limit identification of “and” contractions to common phrases, and add a non-breaking space around them. Common phrases:
	- dead ’n’ buried
	- drill ’n’ bass
	- drum ’n’ bass
	- rock ’n’ roll
	- pick ’n’ mix
	- fish ’n’ chips
	- salt ’n’ shake
	- mac ’n’ cheese
	- pork ’n’ beans
	- drag ’n’ drop
	- rake ’n’ scrape
	- hook ’n’ kill
- Identify and fix single-quoted ‘words’ outside double quotes
- Swap single quotes and terminal punctuation when single quotes are used only for a portion of a sentence, e.g.:
  - …only a ‘quoted part.’  → …only a ‘quoted part’.
- Keep a space between a number and a number sign (#) at the beginning of the paragraph (e.g. when you’re starting a Markdown headline with a number)
- Limit adding a non-breaking space after cardinal and ordinal numbers with three and more digits.


### 🐛 Fixes
- Fix edge cases around double quotes and double primes:
  - Here are 30 "bucks" → Here are 30 “bucks” *(before, a left quote was falsely identified as a double prime)*
  - "Conference 2020" and "something in quotes". → “Conference 2020” and “something in quotes”. *(before, a right quote after “2020” was falsely identified as a double prime)*
  - "2020" → “2020” *(before, dumb quotes around numbers were not identified as a double quote pair)*
  - He was ok. “He was ok ”. → He was ok. “He was ok.”, *(before, when a right double quote was swapped with a terminal punctuation, the extra space wasn’t removed)*
  -  It’s 12" x 12". → It’s 12″ × 12″. *(before, the second prime was falsely identified as a right double quote)*
  - 12'' → 12″ (two dumb single quotes are fixed to a double prime around numbers)
  - When you ask the “How often…” question *(before, the ellipsis was falsely swapped with a right double quote in this type of Sentence)*
  - It’s a“nice” saying. → It’s a “nice” saying. *(now, the added space is a nbsp, when added before a single-word prepositions)*
- When Typopo is configured as  `removeWhitespacesBeforeMarkdownList : false`, Markdown lists are now kept nested, even when they start with `+`


### 🔨 Maintenance
- Refactor a module to fix double quotes
- Refactor a module to fix single quotes
- Update NPM packages to their latest versions



## 2.4.1 // 2021-03-12
No functional changes in this release.

### Maintenance
* Update NPM packages to their latest versions


## 2.4.0 // 2020-11-25

### Fixes
* Remove incidents when a non-breaking space was falsely added after a single-letter word. Before, the script would add an unnecessary nbsp in:
	* “Ctrl+I and…” (i.e. “Ctrl+I⎵and…”),
	* “Ctrl-I and…” (i.e. “Ctrl+I⎵and…”),
	* “Try Ctrl+I” (i.e. “Try⎵Ctrl+I”),
	* “$25M investment” (i.e. “$25M⎵investment”)
* Remove incidents when an ellipsis was accidentally trimmed
	* Before, “Sentence ended. ... and we were there.” was falsely transformed into “Sentence ended… and we were there.” (new behavior: Sentence ended. …and we were there.)
* Remove incidents when commas were accidentally trimmed:
	* Before, “We sell apples, oranges, …, pens.” was falsely transformed into “We sell apples, oranges,… pens.” (new behavior: keep punctuation as is)
* Fix edge cases to match hyphens/dashes between dates
* Fix cases when a space was falsely added into a filename. (e.g. filename.js was falsely transformed into filename .js)

	* 5 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm → 5 mm⎵×⎵5 mm⎵×⎵5 mm
* Fix multiplication sign between words
	* š x v x h  → š⎵×⎵v⎵×⎵h (single letters)
	* mm x mm  → mm⎵×⎵mm (abbreviations)

  * add more use-cases for identifying double/single primes and apostrophes
  * fix accidental swapping of single quotes in Rusyn language with a punctuation
  * fix space after arc

## 2016-12-04

  * remove extra punctuation, e.g. “Hey!,” she said. → “Hey!” she said.
* Code update
  * increase code readability by translating different spaces into variables

## 2016-08-29
  * 1.0.4
  * consolidate placement of non-breaking spaces for multi-character words and numerals
  * consolidate dash replacement (replace -- with – and --- with —)
  * remove trailing spaces


## 2016-08-24
 * 1.0.3
 * add support for Rusyn double quotes «, » and single quoutes ‹, ›
 * fixes
	 * insert non-breaking space before other cyrillic single characters (ї, є, Ї, Є)

## 2016-07-10
 * 1.0.2
 * Fixes
		 * add cyrillic [х, Х] to regex character set

## 2016-04-10
 * 1.0.1
 * New stuff
		 * replace space with non-breaking space after one-word prepositions in Rusyn
		 * fix false positives for sentence case on ordinal numbers in Slovak, Czech and Rusyn language

 * Stuff that went away
		* remove spaces around slashes that are used in dramatic texts (since slashes can be used in various contexts and current implementation was not able to detect them all)

## 2016-03-28
 * 1.0.0
 * correct single quotes and apostrophes
		* single quotes and apostrophes can be mixed and matched in various ways and it’s a bigger task to identify all of incorrectly used single quotes/apostrophes. However, we have thought about different means of how we could identify and correct the most common cases. We're now able to correct them with following assumptions:
				* Double quotes are used in pairs
