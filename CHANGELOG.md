* Remove incidents when commas were accidentally trimmed:
	* Before, “We sell apples, oranges, …, pens.” was falsely transformed into “We sell apples, oranges,… pens.” (new behavior: keep punctuation as is)
* Fix edge cases to match hyphens/dashes between dates
* Fix cases when a space was falsely added into a filename. (e.g. filename.js was falsely transformed into filename .js)

## 2016-03-28
 * 1.0.0
 * correct single quotes and apostrophes
		* single quotes and apostrophes can be mixed and matched in various ways and it’s a bigger task to identify all of incorrectly used single quotes/apostrophes. However, we have thought about different means of how we could identify and correct the most common cases. We're now able to correct them with following assumptions:
				* Double quotes are used in pairs
				* Single quotes are used in pairs
				* Single quotes are used as secondary (ie. within double quotes, which is a convention for currently supported languages — en, sk, cs, rue — [check wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table_for_various_languages))
				* Single quotes are used with proper spacing (ie. a space before Left single quotation mark and a space after Right single quotation mark)
 * [Breaking change] refactor clean_typos() to fixTypos()
